Password Complexity Checker

Creating a password strength evaluation tool involves investigating different features of a password, such as length, character kinds, and patterns.
My code evaluates the password's length, the existence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, and special characters. Based on the criteria rating, the assessment is classified as "weak", "moderate", "strong", or "very strong".
You may modify the specifications and score system to your individual requirements and security standards. To improve the tool's usefulness, consider adding extra checks for common passwords, dictionary words, or patterns.
